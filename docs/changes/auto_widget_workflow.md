# Auto widget workflow - changes summary

This short note documents the files added/updated to provide an automated widget example packaging and installation workflow.

Files added/updated:

- scripts/install_widget_to_xcode.sh (updated): more robust copying, replaces placeholders `group.com.example.mixzer` and `APP_GROUP_PLACEHOLDER`, creates artifacts/widget_example.zip.
- scripts/package_widget.sh (updated): quieter zip creation and idempotent artifact output.
- test/widget_sync_test.dart (added): unit test that mocks the MethodChannel `mixzer_app/widget_sync` and verifies `WidgetSync.writeSummary` calls the native method with a JSON payload.
- docs/macos_development.md (updated): appended a new section describing the automated workflow and example commands.

Acceptance criteria:
- The install script copies widget files to a target folder and replaces placeholders with the provided App Group id.
- The test verifies the Dart side's MethodChannel call.

Notes:
- The script does not modify Xcode project files; you must still open Xcode to configure target bundle ids and signing teams.
- For CI, consider adding a job which runs `flutter test` and optionally packages the widget artifact.
